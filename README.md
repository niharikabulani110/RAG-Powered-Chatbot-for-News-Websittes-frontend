- ðŸ’¬ Real-time chat functionality with the backend
- ðŸ”„ Session management with persistent chat history
- ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI with gradient backgrounds and smooth transitions

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Backend API running (see Backend Setup)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd RAG-Powered-Chatbot-for-News-Websittes-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Update the `.env` file with your backend URL:
   ```
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

## API Endpoints

The frontend communicates with the following backend endpoints:

- `POST /chat`
  - Sends user queries to the backend
  - Body: `{ query: string, session_id: string }`
  - Returns: `{ answer: string, session_id: string }`

- `GET /history/{session_id}`
  - Retrieves chat history for a session
  - Returns: Array of previous messages

- `POST /reset/{session_id}`
  - Resets the chat session
  - Clears chat history

## Session Management

The application implements session management using the following logic:

1. On first load, a new session ID is generated by the backend
2. The session ID is stored in localStorage for persistence
3. All API requests include the session ID
4. The reset button clears the session and starts a new one

## Development

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Deployment

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. The build output will be in the `dist` directory

3. Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your hosting service of choice (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or a static file server)

4. Make sure to set the correct `VITE_BACKEND_URL` environment variable in your hosting platform
